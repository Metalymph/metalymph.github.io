Hi dear readers! Welcome on my first cheatsheet on math analysis.\
Today we'll remember how to calculate a second or third order linear equation or disequation.
We will add a  quick reference on notable products! ðŸ™‚\
Let's go!

### Second order linear equations
given the following assumptions:

```katex
ax^2+bx+c
```
{{< katex "\Delta = b^2 - 4ac" true />}}
 , for:
1) $\Delta > 0 :$ we have two solutions in $\mathbb{R}$
2) $\Delta = 0 :$ we have two solutions (same point) in $\mathbb{R}$
3) $\Delta < 0 :$ we have **no** solution in $\mathbb{R}$ but in $\mathbb{C}$ instead.

Main formula, with $\Delta>=0$: $$x{_1,_2}=\frac{-b - \sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}$$
