### Hi! Thanks so much for reading about me ðŸ¤©

I'm a CS & software developer with a focus on backend systems and programming languages. I like experimenting and learn with new languages and technologies.\
For my degree I've discussed a model based on types derivations on linear aggregate type-system with explicit ownership, in order to proof Rust borrow checker safety in single thread modality (far before the release of the official Rust tech spec).\
In time, I've developed some Restful services, Telegram Bots, Cripto-treading experimental bots, simple compilers components. Currently my main languages are Python and Go and Iâ€™m using them in different contexts from web backend services to CLI apps and also scripting but I also like the Rust concept and projecting myself towards Mojo.\
Only to be clear and honest, I'm not a Java/C/C++/Swift dev, I've only used them in academic or personal small toy projects in time.
Long time guitarist, music is a big part of my life and Iâ€™m a sport lover in the free time.\
For friends also a special wines researcher.

### Is this a blog, a portfolio, or whatever?

I've started this simple site for multiple reasons. The first was to show a simple idea of me yes, but i want also to show to my students all my support for them!
I will write about simple math lessons in cheatsheet format, to have a quick reference on a specific argument, or an example for a specific use case, hoping it will
be useful to follow and replicate ðŸ˜‰. I will try to transate all in italian with my time.  
In the menu you will find my posts; if you can please give it a try, and le me know what you think about EVERYTHING! I will do my best to get better on my work.\
If you want to write me, on my homewpage i've many ways for this.\
I appreciate your time, really thanks a lot!
