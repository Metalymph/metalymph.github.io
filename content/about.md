### Hi! Thanks so much for reading about me ðŸ¤©

I'm a CS & Developer with a focus on programming languages, and passion for Apple platforms and backend services. I like experimenting and learn with new languages and technologies. For my degree I've discussed a model based on types derivations in order to proof Rust borrow checker safety in single thread modality (far before the release of the official Rust tech spec).
In time, I've developed some Restful services, Telegram Bots & server-side services, Cripto-treading experimental bots, simple compilers modules. I use languages like Go, Swift, Python and currently I am interested in Hylo as a new language and modern programming model.
Currently I have more focus on Swift environment.
The concept of programming language itself is not a limit for me, but I'm decidedly not a Java/C++/Php dev neither a frontend web dev; I've only used them in academic or personal small projects in time years ago.
Long time guitarist, music is a big part of my life and Iâ€™m a sport lover in the free time. For friends also a special wines researcher.

### Is this a blog, a portfolio, or whatever?

I've started this simple site for multiple reasons. The first was to show a simple idea of me yes, but i want also to show to my students all my support for them!
I will write about simple math lessons in cheatsheet format, to have a quick reference on a specific argument, or an example for a specific use case, hoping it will
be useful to follow and replicate ðŸ˜‰. I will try to transate all in italian with my time.  
In the menu you will find my posts; if you can please give it a try, and le me know what you think about EVERYTHING! I will do my best to get better on my work.\
If you want to write me, on my homewpage i've many ways for this.\
I appreciate your time, really thanks a lot!
