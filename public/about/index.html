<p>I&rsquo;m a CS &amp; software developer with a focus on backend systems and programming languages. I like experimenting and learn with new languages and technologies.<br>
For my degree I&rsquo;ve discussed a model based on types derivations on linear aggregate type-system with explicit ownership, in order to proof Rust borrow checker safety in single thread modality (far before the release of the official Rust tech spec).<br>
In time, I&rsquo;ve developed some Restful services, Telegram Bots, Cripto-treading experimental bots, simple compilers components. Currently my main languages are Python and Go and Iâ€™m using them in different contexts from web backend services to CLI apps and also scripting but I also like the Rust concept and projecting myself towards Mojo.<br>
Only to be clear and honest, I&rsquo;m not a Java/C/C++/Swift dev, I&rsquo;ve only used them in academic or personal small toy projects in time.
Long time guitarist, music is a big part of my life and Iâ€™m a sport lover in the free time.<br>
For friends also a special wines researcher.</p>
<h3 id="is-this-a-blog-a-portfolio-or-whatever">Is this a blog, a portfolio, or whatever?</h3>
<p>I&rsquo;ve started this simple site for multiple reasons. The first was to show a simple idea of me yes, but i want also to show to my students all my support for them!
I will write about simple math lessons in cheatsheet format, to have a quick reference on a specific argument, or an example for a specific use case, hoping it will
be useful to follow and replicate ðŸ˜‰. I will try to transate all in italian with my time.<br>
In the menu you will find my posts; if you can please give it a try, and le me know what you think about EVERYTHING! I will do my best to get better on my work.<br>
If you want to write me, on my homewpage i&rsquo;ve many ways for this.<br>
I appreciate your time, really thanks a lot!</p>
