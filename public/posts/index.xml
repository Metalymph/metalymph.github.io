<h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>
<h3 id="continuity">Continuity</h3>
<p>If $f(x)$ is defined and <em>continuous</em> in the limit segment we want to calculate, than we can proceed. Put the limit value inside function and see if the result is an <em>L</em> $\in \mathbb{R}$.
A function is continue in a point if the limit from left and right gives the same value in $\mathbb{R}$.
That is:
$$\lim_{x\to\ x_{0}^-} f(x) = L = \lim_{x\to\ x_{0}^+} f(x)$$
A function is continue in a range (or the full $\mathbb{R}$)  if it&rsquo;s continue in all the range&rsquo;s points. Important to note that given two functions, the following operations give an other continue function: $$f(x) g(x),  \frac{f(x)}{g(x)}, f(x)+g(x),  f(x)-g(x),  g(f(x))$$
Discontinuity is given by a finite value from the two limits in the same point.</p>
<h3 id="limits-forms">Limits forms</h3>
<p>Some limits are deetermined, that is, can be calculated <em>just-in-time</em>. Other forms are more complex
and require the use of a theorem or more passes.
<strong>Determinated forms</strong></p>
<p>If <em>L</em> is $[\frac{C}{0^+}], [\frac{C}{0^-}], [\frac{\infty}{0}]$, the limit is $\pm\infty$,
if <em>L</em> is $[\frac{C}{\infty}], [\frac{\infty}{0}]$, the limit is 0</p>
<p><strong>Undeterminated forms</strong></p>
<p>If <em>L</em> is $[\frac{0}{0}], [\frac{\infty}{\infty}], [\infty-\infty], [0^\infty], [0^0], [1^\infty]$ and more&hellip;the limit must be calculated with the right theorem, sometimes challenging&hellip;</p>
<h3 id="theorems">Theorems</h3>
<p>There are some theorems related to limits, useful to calculate some indeterminated forms. Is important to note that
<strong>some limits don&rsquo;t exist</strong> and is essential to know if a limit exists in the <a href="#function-study">function study</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Constant (persistent) sign theorem</strong></p>
<p>If:</p>
<p>$$\lim_{x\to\ x_{0}} f(x) = l \ne 0$$</p>
<p>than, a surrounding area of $x_{0}$ exists, where <strong>both</strong> $l$ and $f(x)$ are <strong>both</strong> positive or both negative.</p>
<p><strong>Comparing theorem</strong>
If you have $ h(x) \le f(x) \le g(x)$ three functions defined in the surrounding area $H$ of $x_{0}$ (not defined in $x_{0}$) so, if in $H$ is always valid:</p>
<p>$$h(x)  \le f(x) \le g(x) $$</p>
<p>than, if the limit for $x\to\ x_{0}$ is $l$, the limit for $f(x)$ is <strong>also</strong> $l$.</p>
<p><strong>Limit uniqueness theorem</strong>
If $f(x)$ has limit $l$ for $x\to\ x_{0}$, than $l$ is <strong>unique</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Notable limits</strong>
There are some limits for whom the existence of limit and proofness is battle-tested. They are known and they are all $\frac{0}{0}$ cases, but not the last (Neplero&rsquo;s number, $1^{\infty} $).
<em>N.B:</em> Not all cases are shown.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Logarithmic</strong> function, with $a &gt; 0$ and $a \ne 1$:
$$\lim_{x\to\ 0}\frac{log_{a}(1+x)}{x} = \frac{1}{ln(a)};  \lim_{f(x) \to 0}\frac{log_{a}(1+f(x))}{f(x)} = \frac{1}{ln(a)}$$</li>
</ul>
<p>so, with $a = e$:
$$\lim_{x\to\ 0}\frac{ln(1+x)}{x} = 1;  \lim_{f(x) \to 0}\frac{ln(1+f(x))}{f(x)} = 1$$</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Exponential</strong> function, with $a &gt; 0$:
$$\lim_{x\to\ 0}\frac{a^x-1}{x} = ln(a);  \lim_{f(x) \to 0}\frac{a^{f(x)}-1}{f(x)} = ln(a)$$</li>
</ul>
<p>so, with $a = e$:
$$\lim_{x\to\ 0}\frac{e^x-1}{x} = 1;  \lim_{f(x) \to 0}\frac{e^{f(x)}-1}{f(x)} = 1$$</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Power with difference</strong> with $c \in \mathbb{R}$:
$$\lim_{x\to\ 0}\frac{(1+x)^c-1}{x} = c;  \lim_{f(x) \to 0}\frac{(1+f(x))^c-1}{f(x)} = c$$</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Neplero&rsquo;s number</strong>
$$\lim_{x\to\ \pm\infty}(1+\frac{1}{x})^x = e;  \lim_{f(x) \to \pm\infty}(1+\frac{1}{f(x)})^{f(x)} = e$$</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h3>
<p>Now you have a good set of sheets to resolve some limits and i hope it will be useful ðŸ™‚!

Today we&amp;rsquo;ll remember how to calculate a second or third order linear equation or disequation. We will add a quick reference on notable products! ðŸ™‚

First order linear equation and disequation We start easily remembering that a first order equation in the form: $$ ax + b = 0 $$ has one and only one solution and we can find it simply moving the factors and executing basic algebraic operations like this: $$ ax = -b; x = -\frac{b}{a}$$ And for disequations?</description>

<h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>
<p>Hi dear readers! Welcome on my first cheatsheet on math analysis.<br>
Today we&rsquo;ll remember how to calculate a second or third order linear equation or disequation.
We will add a  quick reference on notable products! ðŸ™‚<br>
Let&rsquo;s go!</p>
<h3 id="first-order-linear-equation-and-disequation">First order linear equation and disequation</h3>
<p>We start easily remembering that a first order equation in the form:
$$ ax + b = 0 $$
has one and  only one solution and we can find it simply moving the factors and executing basic algebraic operations like this:
$$ ax = -b; x = -\frac{b}{a}$$
And for disequations? Easy! We need only to reverse the sign &lt; to &gt; or viceversa if we apply to both members an algebraic operation
like division or multiplication, et voilÃ !</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="second-order-linear-equations">Second order linear equations</h3>
<p>Given the following assumptions:</p>
<p>$$ ax^2+bx+c, \Delta = b^2 - 4ac $$ for:</p>
<ol>
<li>$\Delta &gt; 0 :$ we have two solutions in $\mathbb{R}$</li>
<li>$\Delta = 0 :$ we have two solutions (same point) in $\mathbb{R}$</li>
<li>$\Delta &lt; 0 :$ we have <strong>no</strong> solution in $\mathbb{R}$ but in $\mathbb{C}$ instead (not treated).</li>
</ol>
<p>Main formula: with $$ (with: \Delta&gt;=0); x{_1,_2}=\frac{-b - \sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a} $$
<strong>Note</strong>: some equations and disequations of second or third order can be instantly
resolved using <a href="#notable-products">notable products</a>.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="second-order-linear-disequations">Second order linear disequations</h3>
<p>For second order disequations, you can resolve the related second order equation and, with $a \ne 0$:</p>
<p>$ax^2+bx+c$ and $\Delta = b^2 - 4ac,$ for:</p>
<ol>
<li>$\Delta &gt; 0 :$ we have two solutions in $\mathbb{R}$, so solution : $x_{1} &lt; x, x &gt; x_{2}$.</li>
<li>$\Delta = 0 :$ we have two solutions (same point) in $\mathbb{R}$, so solution is $\forall x \ne x1,x2$ (where $x_{1}= x_{2}$).</li>
<li>$\Delta &lt; 0 :$ we have <strong>no</strong> solution in $\mathbb{R}$ but in $\mathbb{C}$ instead, so solution is $\forall x \in \R$.</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<h3 id="notable-products">Notable products</h3>
<p>There are some <em>composed polynomials</em> which have a fixed (proofed) solutions. Let&rsquo;s take a look:</p>
<ul>
<li>$(a-b)^2 = a^2+2ab+b^2$</li>
<li>$(a+b+c)^2 = a^2+b^2+2ab+2ac+2bc$</li>
<li>$(a-b+c)^2 = a^2+b^2-2ab+2ac-2bc$</li>
<li>$(a+b)^3 = a^3+3a^2b+3a^b2+b^3$</li>
<li>$(a-b)^3 = a^3-3a^2b+3a^b2-b^3$</li>
<li>$a^2-b^2 = (a-b)(a+b)$</li>
<li>$a^3+b^3 = (a+b)(a^2-ab+b^2)$</li>
<li>$a^3-b^3 = (a-b)(a^2+ab+b^2)$</li>
</ul>
<p>They will be one of the best weapons for you in MANY circumnstances&hellip;</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="third-order-or-more-linear-equations">Third order or more linear equations</h3>
<p>If no notable product is found (look above), than we can <strong>try</strong> the <em>Ruffini&rsquo;s Method</em>. Yes, try, because no result is guaranteed. We shall have at end of the process:</p>
<p>$$P(x)=(x-a)Q(x)$$ with $Q(x)$ as a polinome with $P(x)$-1 order.</p>
<ol>
<li>We need to calculate $f(x)$ substituting $x$ with each divisor of $c$ until we take the result 0 (satisfied equation).</li>
<li>When found, apply the matrix method (<a href="https://www.youmath.it/lezioni/algebra-elementare/polinomi/272-la-regola-di-ruffini.html">see here</a>). The result <strong>must be</strong> 0 for the known term.</li>
<li>Write the result in the given form and apply the method again if necessary (but first, see if you have a <a href="#notable-products">Notable products</a>).</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="logarithms">Logarithms</h3>
<p>The last sheet i want to remember is about logarithms. Here a set of rules for them.</p>
<ul>
<li>$a^{\log{_a}{b}} = b$ (definition)</li>
<li>$\log{_a}{b^c} = c\log{_a}{b}$ (Exponent)</li>
<li>$\log{_a}{bc} = \log{_a}{b}+\log{_a}{c}$ (Product)</li>
<li>$\log{_a}{\frac{b}{c}} = \log{_a}{b}-\log{_a}{c}$ (Quotient)</li>
<li>$\log{_a}{b} = \frac{\log{_c}{b}}{\log{_c}{a}}$ (Base conversion)</li>
<li>$\log{_a}{b} = \frac{1}{\log{_b}{a}}$ (Inversion)</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h3>
<p>Now you have a good set of sheets to resolve many equations and disequations and i hope it will be useful ðŸ™‚!
